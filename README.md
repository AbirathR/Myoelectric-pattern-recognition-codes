Utilized the NINAPRO open-source database containing surface EMG signals data of over 40 real-life subjects. 
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network model based on AlexNet architecture to classify hand grasp movements into ten different classes. 
The classes were decided based on the general taxonomy of hand grasps. Achieved an accuracy of 70% on the 10-label classification problem.
